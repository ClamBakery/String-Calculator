# String-Calculator
A short program that takes a string of digit numbers in the form “//[delimiter(s)]\n[delimiter separated numbers]” and returns the sum of those numbers as a integer. When using multiple delimiters separate them by commas when declaring them. The program also does not allow negative inputs and is not very robust in terms of bad user input.

//@,$$\n1@5@7$$1@2 would return 16. 

Runs on Python 3.7 

Run test by copy pasting following command: python henry_fang_string_calc.py
