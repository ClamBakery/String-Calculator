# String-Calculator
A short program that takes a string of digit numbers in the form “//[delimiter(s)]\n[delimiter separated numbers]” and returns the sum of those numbers as a integer, if a empty string is passed the program returns 0. When using multiple delimiters separate them by commas when declaring them. The program also does not allow negative inputs and is not very robust in terms of bad user input.

//@,$$\n1@5@7$$1@2 would return 16. 

Runs on Python 3.7 

Run tests by copy pasting following command: python henry_fang_string_calc.py

To use the program simply call the add() function with your input string as a parameter.
